NoMoreBoatExploit
=================

A simple and lightweight plugin to remove a very unfriendly boat exploit, if you ever experience server lag or even crashes from too many chunks being loaded then this is most likely your solution...

Installation
------------
For most users it is as easy as putting it in your ``/plugin/`` directory and that's it, if you want to specify commands to be ran or how the scan works then check the Configuration section below.

Permissions
-----------
To exempt a person from these checks simply give them the permission `boatexploit.exempt`

Configuration
-------------
The scan section is pre-configured with values that seem to work very well.
```yaml
